The LDCOPY driver
-----------------

This is a simple OS/2 driver for copying files while CONFIG.SYS is being
processed.  There are various reasons why you might want to do this; for
example, copying different versions of a file into a known place.  Used
in conjunction with the facility for alternate CONFIG.SYS files, it can
be a useful tool. 

The LDCOPY driver performs no useful function except at initialisation
time.  It uses the DosCopy API call to copy the files; this is not
directly documented as a legal call from driver initialisation, but it
seems to work (DosRead, DosWrite, DosOpen and DosClose are OK, so I'd
expect it to be too; it isn't specifically excluded), and indeed has
worked since the early betas of OS/2 2.0 back in 1991!

To use the driver, place it in a directory of your choice (e.g. C:\OS2), and
add a DEVICE statement to the CONFIG.SYS file, e.g.:

                DEVICE=C:\OS2\LDCOPY.SYS sourcefile destinationfile

where 'sourcefile' specifies the name of the file to be copied, and
'destinationfile' specifies the place to which it is to be copied.  Both
filenames must be fully qualified (i.e.  include drive and pathname). 
One limitation is that filenames which include spaces are not supported. 
Any existing 'destinationfile' is overwritten. 

Call the driver multiple times if you want to copy more than one file.

The driver unloads after doing its job, so there is no permanent use of
memory. 

History:
1.0	Initial version.
1.1	Use noncritical init error to unload completely.
